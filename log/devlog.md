# NoteCraft dev log

Terse entries, newest last: what landed, numbers, what's still open. Sessions can end abruptly;
this log plus a green tree is how the next agent picks up.

## 2026-10-14 — bootstrap

- Audited the sibling Crafting Apps (cloned read-only into `.siblings/`, git-ignored):
  `docs/structure-audit.md` records what NoteCraft adopts (workspace layout, lints, profiles,
  `xtask`, packaging, CI, craft-libs pinning) and every conflict with the brief.
- Scaffold: workspace manifest, `xtask` (`layers`, `wasm`, `ci`, `assets`, `parity`, `deny`,
  `version`, `ico`), `notecraft-geom` (L0), AGENTS/CLAUDE/README, licences, NOTICE, ATTRIBUTION,
  omastore, deny.toml, CI and release workflows (the shared craft-common-actions pipeline),
  Linux and web packaging, an original placeholder app icon.
- Toolchain on the dev machine: Rust 1.99 stable (rustup, `~/.cargo`), wasm32 target.
- Still open: the parity catalog and plan (next commit), then M1.
